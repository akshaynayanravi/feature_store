Question 3: Database Design for ML Feature Store

Design a simple database schema for storing and managing ML features. Include proper constraints and relationships between tables.

Requirements: Create table definitions for:
1. Features (store feature definitions and metadata)
2. Feature Values (store actual feature values for entities)
3. Models (store model information that uses these features)

Write SQL queries for:
1. Get all features used by a specific model
2. Find the latest feature values for a given entity
3. Get a summary of how many features each model uses
4. List features that haven't been updated in the last 24 hours

Important
● Document your choice of constraints and relationships
● Define appropriate indexes for query optimization
● Consider data integrity and query performance

Note:
Focus on clarity and simplicity in your schema design. You can use any SQL dialect.
