# Machine Learning Feature Management Database Schema

## Overview

This document outlines a database schema designed for managing machine learning features, feature values, and models. It includes the necessary tables, their relationships, indexing strategies, and SQL queries for common operations.

## Schema Design

The schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Features**: Stores metadata about individual features.
2. **FeatureValues**: Stores actual values for features, including timestamps.
3. **Models**: Stores information about machine learning models that utilize these features.
4. **ModelFeatures**: Associates features with models, supporting many-to-many relationships.
